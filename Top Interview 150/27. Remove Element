THE SOLUTION FOR REMOVE A ELEMENT:

class Solution(object):
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        k=0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i]!=val:
                nums[k]=nums[i]
                k+=1
        return k

PROGRAM EXPLAINATION:

From the above program, the main function is already defined. From the question, k is determined as pointer to denote the index place of nums. nums has some list values and 
val is already given in the program

The program is to eliminate val in nums. To that, assign a for loop.In the for loop, the end value will be thw len(nums).
Iteration 1:
i=0, nums[0]=3(from the given question) , 
if 3!=3 ----> false. so don't do anything

Iteration 2:
i=1, nums[1]=2(from the given question) , 
if 2!=3 ----> true. so assign nums[0]=3 as nums[0]=nums[1] ---> nums[0]=2 and k=1 now

Iteration 3:
i=2, nums[2]=2(from the given question) , 
if 2!=3 ----> true. so assign nums[1]=2 as nums[1]=nums[2] ---> nums[1]=2 and k=2 now

Iteration 4:
i=3, nums[3]=3(from the given question) , 
if 3!=3 ----> false

FINALLY return k which is 2

In the main function, already assigned that print the values upto k.From nums, it iterates and print upto k-1. Because the end value will be always end-1
